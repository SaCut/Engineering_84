## TAMY

Hello, My name is Saverio, I'm from Italy, and I have a degree in Eastern Languages and Linguistics.

I've always had a passion for technology, so after working as a translator after graduation I decided to redirect my career and
improve my coding skills by following courses online and getting practical experince on actual code.

Since then I've developed many small projects in Python, using various libraries and frameworks, trying to apply common principles
like object oriented programming and readable code with appropriate documentation.

Among the projects I worked on there are image manipulation for object detection, face recognition tools, web scapers and simple
user interfaces.

I've also used Linux desktop for ten years now, so I also have a bit of practive with command line interfaces and virtual machines.

Now as a next step I'm attending the Sparta Global training for Junior DevOps Consultant.

I'm very interested in Science and Technology and like to keep updated with the latest news on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

## Interview questions

#### Question: What is Agile and what are the benefits of implementing it?
* Answer: Agile is a set of principles for software development based on the best practices that have been observed to lead to
consistently better results over the years.
Agile is based on four core principles that define some priorities in opposition to the old way of looking at software development,
and they are:
  * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools: the individual skills of the people working on a project should take
  precedence over any weight given to the tools used to manage and develop said projects;
  * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation: the aim of a company is releasing a product, so releasing software that
  can be actually used by the user/customer comes before writing extensive and detailed documentation for said project.
  * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation: this principle encourages to look at the customer in a collaborative wiev,
  as that will lead to a better end-result than prioritising the contract and viewing the relation with the customer as adversarial.
  * **Responding to change** over following a plan: adaptability is foundational in agile. The method encourages looking at the code
  in a modular light, to be shaped and rearraged in response to the customer feedback and to whatever need might arise during development.

#### What is DevOps and the what are the benefits of using it?
- Answer: The term DevOps comes from the union of Development and Operations, which means that DevOps evolved as a bridge to mend the gap
between Software development, that often found themselves at odds by working in compartmentalised units. By improving communication and
bringing everyone into the same team, the process becomes far smoother and the product lifecycle is greatly improved.

#### Question: Why did you choose Sparta Global?
- Answer: I chose Sparta Global because, in addition to an impressive growth in recent years and many collaborations with important clients,
they have shown to have top notch training and to follow their Spartans closely throughout the whole consultancy.

#### Question: What is SCRUM and what are the benefits of implementing it?
- Answer: Scrum is a framework in the Agile methodology that aims to improve the work of the team collaborating on a project. It's based on
constant iterations and reviews, by setting recurring sprints and working through them one step at a time. The aim of Scrum is to improve
transparency for the whole team, to make sure that everyone is on the same page and that problems are addressed as soon as possible, and that
the simplicity is maintained and no unecessary work is performed.

#### Question: Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time
- Answer: In the short term I see myself as working as a Junior DevOps Consultant at Sparta GLobal, but after that I plan on taking advantage
of the experience I've accumulated in this role and progress my career up to Senior in DevOps, or maybe any related opportunities that require
a similar skillset.
